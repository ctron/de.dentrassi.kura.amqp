# Kura Drools example #1

This is a simple example showing the basic integration of Kura and Drools. It doesn't really integrate
into Kura's API, but only shows that running Drools inside of Kura is technically possible.

## Installation

You need to install in the `de.dentrassi.kura.addons.drools.core_*.dp` package into a running Kura instance
before installing this example. This provides the basic Drools dependencies in a way Kura can consume them.

Next install the example by adding the package `de.dentrassi.kura.addons.drools.examples.examples1_*.dp` to
the Kura instance.


## Usage

Using the command line you can now trigger the command `drools:test1` and you will see some output like:

~~~
osgi> drools:test1
Result: 1
~~~

The result is being generated by the Drools rules from this example.
